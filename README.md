## Traffic Lane Recognition using Edge Detection and the Hough Transform
Traffic lane markings are detected from image or video input. Below is a typical implementation, where the overlaid red lines have been generated by the algorithm described below and in further detail at [www.lrgonzales.com/traffic-lane-recognition](http://www.lrgonzales.com/traffic-lane-recognition).

### Algorithm
The algorithm has three steps, summarized below. Edge detection and the Hough transform are covered in further detail at [www.lrgonzales.com/traffic-lane-recognition](http://www.lrgonzales.com/traffic-lane-recognition).

* Grayscale conversion
* Edge detection
* Hough transform for linear feature identification

The Canny edge detector (`cv2.Canny`) was chosen for edge detection, particularly because edges in the input image are reduced to single-pixel width lines, a useful feature for the following Hough Transform processing. The Hough transform (`cv2.HoughLinesP`) then evaluates these identified edges pixel-by-pixel and determines whether a line (lane marking) exists.

To gain experience with the implementation details of edge detection and the Hough transform, I implemented my own methods (`src/edge_det.py` and `src/hough.py`). Edge detection proved to be a very mechanical process, where kernel convolution produced horizontal and vertical gradients and these gradients were then combined with non-maximum suppression and thresholding to produce an output image. On the other hand, the Hough transform was challenging to implement in a computationally-efficient manner.

### Usage
Given the directory structure of the repository, particularly `input/image.jpg`, the program may be executed at the command line with `python lane_recog.py input/image.jpg`. 

### Improvements
The `src/` implementation of the Hough transform could benefit from an accumulator not implemented as a `list`. Doing so would likely result in on-par performance to the OpenCV implementation.

The literature suggests that a fraction of the remaining pixels after edge detection may be able to be ignored. `src/hough.py` does consider all white pixels post-edge detection. Improved implementations may consider the trade-off between the fraction of ignored pixels and accuracy.

Expecting completion of `README` by April 13, 2018.

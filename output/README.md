After executing the program:

`edge-det.jpg` is the output of edge detection on the input image.

`edge-det-hough.jpg` combines the edge detected image and the lines captured by Hough transform. In particular, Hough transform is performed only within the yellow trapezoid.

`lane-recognition.jpg` overlays the result of the Hough transform on the original input image.

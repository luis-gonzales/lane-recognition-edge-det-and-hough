Upon successful execution of the program:

* `edge-det.jpg` is the output of edge detection on the input image.

* `edge-det-hough.jpg` combines the edge detected image and the result of the applied Hough transform. In particular, the Hough transform is performed only within the shown yellow trapezoid.

* `lane-recognition.jpg` overlays the result of the Hough transform on the original input image.
